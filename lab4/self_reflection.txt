All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Use a method resizing that takes a int number and replace lst by T[number] to contain grow and shrink both, then written grow and shrink. It is flex more.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I have a flex resizing method and use readable statements/abstraction, for examples, the method isEmpty. I am solving a problem
as a unit.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:I have not comment for any method. I have not compared the advantages of not storing item in last pointer (I have gotten touch of it ever).

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:Compare the advantages of not storing item in last pointer, comment for every method.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:advantages of not storing in last pointer, grow and shrink, quick comment;

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:I will write comments for all methods, more higher abstraction.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:finish that without error.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:Method remove use too much variable. The init sentinel Node is not circle, which raise a special case.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:less variable. Invariant structure to prevent special case

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A:Init sentinel should be circle. less row.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: It is nice.
